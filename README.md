# CCO-design-patterns

A repository for the coordination of efforts in the National Center for Ontological Research (NCOR) in creating design patterns for the Common Core Ontologies (CCO). 
The aim of creating these patterns is to lower the barrier of entry into using CCO, as well as creating a shared consensus on the usage of CCO resources.
