# CCO-design-patterns

A repository for the coordination of efforts in the National Center for Ontological Research (NCOR) in creating design patterns for the Common Core Ontologies (CCO). 
The aim of creating these patterns is to lower the barrier of entry into using CCO, as well as creating a shared consensus on the usage of CCO resources.

The main folder contains a .pdf with preliminary slides outlining existing design patterns to be vetted and translated into Mermaid format. 

The preferred format for design patterns is Mermaid, although an image in PNG or similar formats should also be provided.

Background information on design patterns can be found in the paper at this link: https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13326-017-0126-0
